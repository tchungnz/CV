I'm a fresh-minded developer with a background in management and digital consulting.

I've worked on a range of strategy projects and made a tonne of powerpoint slides whilst working in the corporate world, but I've always loved dreaming about new ideas.

So, I recently took the plunge and completed a software development course at Makers Academy to give me the technical skills to build something with my own two hands.

I've now found something that really excites and motivates me and I'm looking for a mobile app developer job that's fast moving, hands-on and welcomes a creative mind.

## Skills

#### Solving problems
From the first lego set I put together at age 5, to making a rubber band powered car during engineering school, to developing a corporate strategy for a leading bank as a consultant, and now being able to build my own app as a developer, I've always loved the challenge of solving a problem.

#### Taking the lead
I've directly mentored two graduates as a career counsellor and led department initiatives to improve team culture and information management.

#### Explaining things
I'm able to teach my 5 year old nephew how to play computer games, but also work directly with executive level clients, including experience facilitating interviews and workshops. I've also run graduate training courses on excel and core consulting skills.

#### Managing projects
I've managed a wide range of projects from planning all the way through to client delivery. I've also had experience leading small teams with up to three direct reports.
